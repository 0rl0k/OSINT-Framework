# ARF
Advanced Reconnaissance Framework

http://osintframework.com



## Notes
OSINT framework focused on gathering information from free tools or resources.  Everything inlcuded in the framework should be either entirely free, return some free information, or at the very least have a free trial available.

I originally created this framework with an information security point of view.  Since then, the response from other fields and disciplines has been awesome.  I would love to be able to include any other OSINT resources, especially from fields outside of infosec.  Please let me know about anything that might be missing!
